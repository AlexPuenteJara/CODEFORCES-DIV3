Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:</p><ul> <li> if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one; </li><li> if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit). </li></ul><p>You are given an integer number $$$n$$$.
