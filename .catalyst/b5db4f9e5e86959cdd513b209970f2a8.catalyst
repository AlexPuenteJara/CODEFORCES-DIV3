Your task is to find the number of connected components which are cycles.</p><p>Here are some definitions of graph theory.</p><p>An undirected graph consists of two sets: set of nodes (called vertices) and set of edges. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. All edges are bidirectional (i.e. if a vertex $$$a$$$ is connected with a vertex $$$b$$$, a vertex $$$b$$$ is also connected with a vertex $$$a$$$). An edge can't connect vertex with itself, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices.</p><p>Two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.</p><p>A connected component is a cycle if and only if its vertices can be reordered in such a way that:</p><ul> <li> the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge, </li><li> the second vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge, </li><li> ... </li><li> the last vertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge, </li><li> all the described edges of a cycle are distinct. </li></ul><p>A cycle doesn't contain any other edges except described above. By definition any cycle contains three or more vertices.</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/69828f4d3554b0093ff12f1466d664d757de7a79.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\">   <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">There are $$$6$$$ connected components, $$$2$$$ of them are cycles: $$$[7, 10, 16]$$$ and $$$[5, 11, 9, 15]$$$.</span> </center>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integer numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \\le m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — number of vertices and edges.</p><p>The following $$$m$$$ lines contains edges: edge $$$i$$$ is given as a pair of vertices $$$v_i$$$, $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\ne v_i$$$).
