You can erase any elements, not necessarily going successively. The remaining elements preserve their order. For example, for the array $$$[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]$$$ the following arrays are subsequences: $$$[3]$$$, $$$[5, 3, 1, 2, 4]$$$, $$$[5, 1, 4]$$$, but the array $$$[1, 3]$$$ is not.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of the input containing integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.
